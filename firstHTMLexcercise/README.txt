questions about git:
1. what is origin?
2. what is the relationship between tracked repository on my local comptuer
and github repository? Is there no dependecy between them?
3. before push I have to define 'origin'? to set the url? so what is 'add origin'??
4.push origin master vs push origin?
5. the branches relevant only for the remote?
6. is 'add origin' is per local repo?
